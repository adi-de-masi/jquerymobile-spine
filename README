A very simple proof of concept that shows how jquerymobile.com and spinejs.com can be combined.

Note that the basic structure was generated using Spine.app. Modifications:
- remove jqueryify from slug.json and uninstall it by removing it from package.json and not requiring it in app/lib/setup.coffee
- include jquery and -mobile libraries in public/index.html
- bind to mobileinit for initializing Spine
- use the pagebeforechange event for intercepting the regualar page jquerymobile page rendering workflow. there you can generate markup client-side (done here with coffeescript-haml)
